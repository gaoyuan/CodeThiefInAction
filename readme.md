A graduated size and color hexbin that displays the total value of diamonds of a particular carat and depth from a dataset of 50k+ such diamonds. The style follows that of [Scatterplot Matrix Techniques for Large N](http://anothersample.net/scatterplot-matrix-techniques-for-large-n). Graduated hexbins that aggregate value do a better job of showing spatial distribution of values, as contrasted with graduated symbols that occlude each other as well as the region their purport to represent.

[Here's a version that shows the raw number of items in each hex using the same color and symbology.](http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/613cd391ba7e9a3a4042)
