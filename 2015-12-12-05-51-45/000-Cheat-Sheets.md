Developer Cheat Sheets
======================

This are my cheat sheets that I have compiled over the years. Tired of searching
Google for the same things, I started adding the information here. As time went
on, this list has grown. I use this almost everyday and this Gist is the first
bookmark on my list for quick and easy access.

I recommend that you compile your own list of cheat sheets as typing out the
commands has been super helpful in allowing me to retain the information longer.

> **NOTE**: I have this page as my first bookmark in my address bar so that I am
> able to easily come back here. I edit this page often and when I find gems of
> knowledge, I will often place them in here.
