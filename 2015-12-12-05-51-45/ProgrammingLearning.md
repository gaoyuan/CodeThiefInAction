##whoami ?
I am an engineering student who love programming. I love it SO MUCH that I want to help other people like it. For this purpose I created a project to get anybody started with programming, but I don't have enough knowledge yet to make it big, so if you want to help, feel free to do so !

##You want to learn ?    
You are a young programmer who want to learn a new language ? Then check the [project](https://github.com/P1kachu/ProgrammingLearning#how-to-learn-a-language) out !    
You'll get the basic syntax to start coding quickly !     
There are already more than 11 [programming languages](https://github.com/P1kachu/ProgrammingLearning#languages-currently-available) available and more to come !    
You can help by providing feedback, opening issues if there is any problem and stuff like that. If you think some exercise could be added, tell us !

##You want to teach ?
You are a skillful programmer who want to teach how to code in your favourite language ? Check the corrections 
already there and if one is missing or incomplete, please bring your knowledge ! The purpose of this [project](https://github.com/P1kachu/ProgrammingLearning#how-to-learn-a-language) is to help young programmers who want to expand their capabilities !
