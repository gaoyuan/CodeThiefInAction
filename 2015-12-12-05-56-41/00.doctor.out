Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!

Warning: The system curl on 10.6 and below is often incapable of supporting
modern secure connections & will fail on fetching formulae.
We recommend you:
  brew install curl

Warning: Unbrewed dylibs were found in /usr/local/lib.
If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when
building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.

Unexpected dylibs:
    /usr/local/lib/libMonoPosixHelper.dylib
    /usr/local/lib/libSFFileMonitor.32.dylib
    /usr/local/lib/libSFIPC.32.dylib
    /usr/local/lib/libSFIPC.I.dylib
    /usr/local/lib/libSFsqlite3.7.4.dylib
    /usr/local/lib/libSFSyncEngine.I.dylib

Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar
Leaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause brews that depend on
those kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:
    ruby

Warning: Some keg-only formula are linked into the Cellar.
Linking a keg-only formula, such as gettext, into the cellar with
`brew link <formula>` will cause other formulae to detect them during
the `./configure` step. This may cause problems when compiling those
other formulae.

Binaries provided by keg-only formulae may override system binaries
with other strange results.

You may wish to `brew unlink` these brews:
    perl
